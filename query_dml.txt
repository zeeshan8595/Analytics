/* JOINS */
-- joins are used to combine rows from two or more  tables--
-- in both tables payment and customer we have a common column 'customer_id',using inner join we can see
-- we want first name and last name of the customer and the amount they have paid.
-- the first and last name is in customer table and the amount paid is in payment table , so here we need 
-- to join the two tables. for joining these two tables we need a common coloumn in both of the tables 
-- using this common column customer_id we can able to join these tables and get the desired output.
-- see beloe example

select * from payment
select * from customer

select c.first_name,c.last_name,p.amount,p.payment_date
from customer c
INNER JOIN  payment p on c.customer_id=p.customer_id;

-- one more example
-- i want full address i:e--> address, district, city ,phone number ,we have address and distrcit,phone in address table
-- and we have city in city table so we need to join the address table and city table using common column called city_id
select * from address
select * from city

select a.address,a.district,a.phone,c.city
